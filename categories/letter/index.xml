        <description>best closing for cover letter.This is where you try to capture the hiring manager’s attention and emphasize your unique qualifications for the job, without repeating the same exact information you’ve included on your resume. This method of closing a letter is best used with longer, more formal emails, letters of rejection, and those correspondences that may contain difficult topics. The golden rule for any cover letter rings true for the cover letter closing: The sentiment expressed implies a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation while continuing to maintain a formal tone that is often essential in the work place.</description>
